# Red Hello World Container

Single webpage displaying the hostname on a red background.

## Why?

`red_helloworld` is intended for testing with docker images. It is part of a collection I have made each with different background colours; useful for testing load balancing and routing.

## Use

Simply run
```
docker pull theyorkshiredev/red_helloworld
```
